A Jekyll version of the "Phantom" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/).

# How to Use

For those unfamiliar with how Jekyll works, check out [https://jekyllrb.com/](https://jekyllrb.com/) for all the details, 
or read up on just the basics of [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), [writing posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/), 
and [creating pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/).

- **GitLab**: Simply fork this repository and start editing the `_config.yml` file!
- **GitHub**: Fork this reposity and create a branch named `gh-pages`, then start editing the `_config.yml` file!

# Added Features

I've integrated lots of nice Jekyll features into the theme, such as:
* [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/) contact form integration - just add your email to the `_config.yml` and it works!
* Your social profiles are linked from usernames you enter in `_config.yml`. Only social profiles buttons you enter in `config.yml` show up on the site footer.
* Site logo support - Easily set any image or [Font Awesome icon](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) as your logo. If you enter a Font Awesome icon class in `_config.yml` it will override the default image used as the site logo.
* **Coming soon**: Featured images and thumbnails in front matter for the homepage posts grid.
* **Coming soon**: Easy featured image settings in `_config.yml` - choose to have Jekyll use a set height for featured images or have it display the entire image, pushing the page content further down.

This is Phantom, a simple design built around a grid of large, colorful, semi-interactive
image tiles (of which you can have as many or as few as you like). Makes use of some
SVG and animation techniques I've been experimenting with on that other project of mine
you may have heard about (https://carrd.co), and includes a handy generic page for whatever.

you can use for pretty much whatever.
